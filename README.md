# UPI Offline Mesh — Demo

Building a Zero-Connectivity UPI Settlement Engine in Spring Boot
Imagine being trapped in a concrete basement with absolutely no cellular network, yet successfully transferring ₹500 to a friend. This project demonstrates how offline UPI payloads can be securely encrypted and broadcasted over a local Bluetooth-style mesh network. The data packet hops seamlessly from device to device until a peer transitions to an area with 4G/5G connectivity. Once back online, that device silently relays the packet to this Spring Boot backend, which handles decryption, strict deduplication, and final ledger settlement.

1. Developed a Spring Boot backend to demonstrate offline UPI payments routed via a Bluetooth‑style mesh network.

2. Implemented hybrid RSA‑OAEP + AES‑GCM encryption to ensure secure, tamper‑proof transactions across untrusted devices.

3. Designed idempotency handling with atomic compare‑and‑set on ciphertext hashes to prevent duplicate settlements.

4. Built a simulator to model gossip‑based packet propagation and bridge node uploads for end‑to‑end demo flow.

5. Integrated H2 in‑memory database and REST APIs with a dashboard UI for transaction visualization and testing.


The system shows three things working end to end:

1. **A payment can travel from sender to backend through untrusted intermediaries** without any of them being able to read or tamper with it. (Hybrid RSA + AES-GCM encryption.)
2. **Even if the same payment reaches the backend simultaneously through multiple bridge nodes, it settles exactly once.** (Idempotency via atomic compare-and-set on the ciphertext hash.)
3. **A tampered or replayed packet is rejected** before it touches the ledger.

You'll see all three in the dashboard.

The interesting one is `IdempotencyConcurrencyTest` — it fires three threads delivering the same packet simultaneously and asserts that exactly one settles.

## The demo flow:-

The dashboard has four buttons that walk through the full pipeline. The intended sequence:

### Step 1 — Compose a payment

Choose sender, receiver, amount, PIN. Click **"📤 Inject into Mesh"**.

**What actually happens on the backend:**
- The server pretends to be the sender's phone.
- It builds a `PaymentInstruction` with a unique nonce and current timestamp.
- It encrypts that with the server's RSA public key (using hybrid encryption — see below).
- It wraps the ciphertext in a `MeshPacket` with a TTL of 5.
- It hands the packet to `phone-alice`, an offline virtual device.

You'll see `phone-alice` now holds 1 packet.

### Step 2 — Run gossip rounds

Click **"🔄 Run Gossip Round"**. Then click it again.

Each round, every device that holds a packet broadcasts it to every other device within "Bluetooth range" (which, in our simulator, means everyone). TTL decrements per hop.

After 1 round: every device holds the packet. After 2 rounds: still every device — TTL is just lower.

In the real system this would happen organically as people walk past each other in the basement.

### Step 3 — Bridge node walks outside

Click **"📡 Bridges Upload to Backend"**.

`phone-bridge` is the only device with `hasInternet=true`. The dashboard simulates that phone walking outside and getting 4G. It POSTs every packet it holds to `/api/bridge/ingest`.

The backend pipeline runs:
1. Hash the ciphertext (`SHA-256`).
2. Try to claim the hash in the idempotency cache.
3. If claimed: decrypt with the server's RSA private key.
4. Verify freshness (signedAt within 24 hours).
5. Run the debit/credit in a single DB transaction.

Watch the **Account Balances** table — money has moved. Watch the **Transaction Ledger** — a new row appears.

### Step 4 — Demonstrate idempotency (the killer feature)

Reset the mesh. Inject a single packet. Run gossip 2 times. Now **all 5 devices hold the same packet, including multiple bridges in a more complex setup**.

To really see idempotency in action, modify `MeshSimulatorService.java` to seed multiple bridge devices, or just:

1. Click "Inject" once.
2. Click "Gossip" twice.
3. Click "Flush Bridges" — only `phone-bridge` is a bridge in the default seed, so just one upload happens.

To exercise the *concurrent duplicate* case properly, run the test:
```cmd
mvnw.cmd test -Dtest=IdempotencyConcurrencyTest#singlePacketDeliveredByThreeBridgesSettlesExactlyOnce
```

This test creates one packet, fires 3 threads at `BridgeIngestionService.ingest()` simultaneously, and verifies that exactly one settles, two are dropped as duplicates, and the sender is debited exactly once.

## The three hard problems and how they're solved

### Problem 1: Untrusted intermediates

A random stranger's phone is carrying your transaction. How do you stop them from reading the amount or changing it?

**Solution: Hybrid encryption (RSA-OAEP + AES-GCM).**

The sender encrypts the payload with the server's public key. Only the server holds the private key, so intermediates see opaque ciphertext.

But RSA can only encrypt small data (~245 bytes for a 2048-bit key), and our payload is JSON that could exceed that. So we use the standard hybrid pattern:

1. Generate a fresh AES-256 key for *this packet*.
2. Encrypt the JSON with **AES-256-GCM** (fast + authenticated).
3. Encrypt just the AES key with **RSA-OAEP**.
4. Concatenate: `[256 bytes RSA-encrypted AES key][12 bytes IV][AES ciphertext + 16-byte GCM tag]`.

**Why GCM specifically?** It's authenticated encryption. If an intermediate flips one bit anywhere in the ciphertext, decryption throws an exception — the GCM tag won't verify. The server cannot be tricked into processing tampered data.

This is the same scheme TLS uses. See `HybridCryptoService.java`.

### Problem 2: The duplicate-storm

Three bridge nodes hold the same packet. They all walk outside at the same instant. They all POST to `/api/bridge/ingest` within milliseconds of each other. If you naively process all three, the sender is debited ₹1500 instead of ₹500.

**Solution: Atomic compare-and-set on the ciphertext hash.**

The very first thing the server does on receiving a packet is compute `SHA-256(ciphertext)` and try to "claim" that hash:

```java
// IdempotencyService.java
Instant prev = seen.putIfAbsent(packetHash, now);
return prev == null;  // true = first claimer, false = duplicate
```

`ConcurrentHashMap.putIfAbsent` is atomic. Even if 100 threads call it at the exact same nanosecond, exactly one returns `null` (the first claimer) and the rest return the existing entry. Only the first claimer proceeds to decrypt and settle. The rest are short-circuited as `DUPLICATE_DROPPED`.

**Why hash the ciphertext, not the packetId or the cleartext?**
- `packetId` can be rewritten by a malicious intermediate. Two copies of the same payment could have different packetIds. Bad key.
- The cleartext requires decryption first. We want to dedupe *before* spending CPU on RSA.
- The ciphertext is authenticated by GCM, so any tampering is detectable on decrypt. Two legitimate deliveries of the same payment have byte-identical ciphertexts (AES is deterministic for a given key+IV+plaintext, and the same packet means the same key+IV+plaintext).

In production this `ConcurrentHashMap` becomes Redis: `SET key NX EX 86400`. Same semantics, distributed across replicas.

There's also a defense-in-depth fallback: `transactions.packet_hash` has a unique index. If the cache layer ever fails and two settlements somehow try to write the same hash, the database rejects the second one.

### Problem 3: Replay attacks

An attacker who captured a ciphertext weeks ago could replay it whenever convenient.

**Solution: Two layers.**

1. **Inside the encrypted payload**, the sender includes `signedAt` (epoch millis). The server rejects any packet older than 24 hours. The attacker can't change `signedAt` without breaking the GCM tag.
2. **Inside the encrypted payload**, the sender includes a **nonce** (UUID). Even if Alice legitimately sends Bob ₹100 twice, the nonces differ → ciphertexts differ → hashes differ → both settle. But a *replay* of one specific signed packet is byte-identical, so the idempotency cache catches it.

See `BridgeIngestionService.java` for the freshness check.

## Tests

Run all tests:
```
mvnw.cmd test
```

The three included tests:

- **`encryptDecryptRoundTrip`** — sanity-check that hybrid encryption is symmetric.
- **`tamperedCiphertextIsRejected`** — flip a byte in the ciphertext, verify that `BridgeIngestionService` returns `INVALID` instead of crashing or settling.
- **`singlePacketDeliveredByThreeBridgesSettlesExactlyOnce`** — the headline test. Three threads, one packet, simultaneous delivery. Asserts exactly one `SETTLED`, two `DUPLICATE_DROPPED`, and that the sender's balance changed by exactly the amount once.

## What's NOT real (and what would change for production)

This is a teaching demo. To make it production-grade you'd swap these things:

| What's in the demo | What it would be in production |
|---|---|
| H2 in-memory DB | PostgreSQL / MySQL with replicas |
| `ConcurrentHashMap` for idempotency | Redis with `SET NX EX` |
| RSA keypair regenerated on every startup | Private key in HSM (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault). Public key cached on devices. |
| Server-side `DemoService.createPacket()` | Same code running on Android, in a Kotlin port |
| Software-simulated mesh (`MeshSimulatorService`) | Real BLE GATT or Wi-Fi Direct between phones |
| One settlement service that owns the ledger | Integration with NPCI / a real bank core |
| No auth on `/api/bridge/ingest` | Mutual TLS or signed bridge-node certificates |
| In-memory accounts seeded on startup | Real KYC'd users, real VPAs, real PIN verification against the bank |
| H2 console exposed | Disabled |
| No rate limiting | Per-bridge-node rate limit, per-sender velocity check |
| Logs to console | Structured logs to a SIEM, alerts on `INVALID` spikes |

The cryptography and idempotency code is essentially production-shaped. The infrastructure around it is what changes.

## few loopholes of this concept

I want this README to be useful to you when someone reviews the project, so let's be straight about what this design **does not** solve. These are not implementation bugs — they're inherent to "no internet, anywhere in the chain":

1. **The receiver has no way to verify the sender has the funds.** When sender hands receiver a phone showing "₹500 sent," it's an IOU, not a settled payment. If the sender's account is empty when the packet finally reaches the backend, the settlement will be `REJECTED` and the receiver is out ₹500 with no recourse. *This is why real offline UPI (UPI Lite) uses a pre-funded hardware-backed wallet* — to give cryptographic proof of available funds offline.
2. **A malicious sender can double-spend offline.** With ₹500 in their account, they could send a packet to Bob in basement A, walk to basement B, and send another ₹500 to Carol. Whichever packet hits the backend first wins; the other gets `REJECTED`. Same root cause as #1.
3. **Bluetooth in real life is hard.** Background BLE on Android is heavily throttled since Android 8. iOS peripheral mode is locked down. Two strangers' phones reliably forming a GATT connection while the apps aren't actively open is genuinely difficult and a lot of energy. This demo skips that problem entirely by simulating the mesh.
4. **Privacy / liability.** A stranger carries your encrypted transaction packet on their phone. They can't read it, but its existence is metadata. In a real deployment you'd want to think about regulatory disclosures and what happens if a device is seized.
